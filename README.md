# COVID-19 AirBnB Data Analysis repo

### Libraries used

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- os

### Motivation

I have gathered data from AirBnB (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) for London for the months of Jan 2020 and Jan 2021 and was interested in the reduction in occupied properties and if there is reduction in the prices. 

The notebook will answer these main questions:
- Is there an effect on the general occupancy
- Is that effect the same for properties with higher number of reviews
- Is there a noticable effect on the prices of the properties from Jan 2020 to Jan 2021. 

### Files in repo
- AirBnB London.ipynb - Jupyter notebook with the main portion of the work
- listings_Jan_2020.csv - AirBnB listings data for Jan 2020 
- listings_Jan_2021.csv - AirBnB listings data for Jan 2021
- README.md - readme for the project

### Findings:

1. Reduction of overall bookins was 50% for one year 
2. Hotel prices were down by about 50% in Jan 2021
3. People preffered booking more reviewed properties - risking with new listings less.
